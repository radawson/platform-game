/* grid system jump - +3
automatic -1 every second */

// spike logic

// death event
// if no health points then activate dead screen
// death screen includes message and replay option also include current score

// collect star

// when all star(s) collected
// win event including replay option
// include score and possibly time?

// reset button, resets time, position, health, score, stars
// track time, begins on load
